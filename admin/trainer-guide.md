# Trainer Guide 

These are the logical steps for a trainer to prep for a course (details below):
- Get a Gardener cluster for your training (separate) as documented here (TODO)
- You can use the participant VM also for all work as a trainer.
- Download your trainer .kube/config from Gardener that lets you control the cluster
- Run the script to generate the kube configs for the participants
- Copy the generated configs to the config share of this course 
- Print the access IDs sheet to be handed out to the participants (with their config IDs)

All artifacts / scripts / info needed as trainer is in this admin folder.
