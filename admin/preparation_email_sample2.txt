Subject: Training: Cloud Curriculum, 'Docker & K8s Fundamentals'

!!!TODO TRAINER!!! before sending this mail: adapt the <<place-holders>> accordingly - and then remove this TODO ;-)

Dear colleagues,


we’re preparing the last bits and pieces of content for next week’s training on Docker & K8s Fundamentals.
To make sure, we’re ready to start, we would like to share a few information upfront and ask you for some preparation as well.

Though we have some PowerPoint slide decks prepared, this is meant to be a hands-on training. To make this as easy as possible, we prepared a VM image for VMWare Player. It contains everything you need during the training. From a technical perspective it should be possible to do the exercises also with a combination of Docker for Windows (hyper-V based Linux VM) or Mac (based on virtualBox). But as these setups are highly customizable & heterogenous, we don’t give support during the training for it.

For the Kubernetes exercises we will use a cluster running on the latest Gardener canary landscape, backed by GCP VMs. For the exercises we will grant you access to it during the training.

To have a smooth start, please:
-	bring your laptop along. We will be working with the local Linux VM (Ubuntu).
-	install VMWare Player & download the VM image as described here: https://github.wdf.sap.corp/cloud-native-dev/k8s-training-vm/blob/master/VMImage_GettingStarted.md
-	[optional] take a look at the links here: <<coursematerial base URL, most likely https://github.wdf.sap.corp/slvi/docker-k8s-training , otherwise your fork  >> /blob/master/preparation.md 

We’re looking forward to meeting you next week.

Best regards,
<< trainers >>
