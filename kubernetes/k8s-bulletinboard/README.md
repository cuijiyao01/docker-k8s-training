# Microservice based Application in Kubernetes using Cloud Curriculum Sample Application "Bulletinboard"
- In the following **5 exercises** you will learn how to make available a microservice based business application in Kubernetes. 
- As sample application we are using a slightly adapted version of **[Bulletinboard from the Cloud Curriculum](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/cc-java-dev/cc-coursematerial/wiki)**. 
- The Bulletinboard is build up by two individual microservices - **Bulletinboard-Ads** and **Bulletinboard-Users**, which communicate across each others to **list**, **create** and **delete Advertisements**. Both have an own database to store data.
- The overall structure of Bulletinboard, incl. the different **K8s entities**, needed for Kubernetes can be found in the following picture.

_Legend: `ingr`: Ingress, `svc`: Service, `nwp`: Network policy, `cm`: Configmap, `sec`: Secret_


## Exercises
### [Exercise: "Setup Bulletinboard-Ads Database"](exercise_01_ads_db.md)
- Database will run as a statefulset: Create prerequisites and configuration entities: configmap-init, init-secret, secret and service
- Create a statefulset for the ads DB, based on above entities.


### [Exercise: "Setup Bulletinboard-Ads Application"](exercise_02_ads_app.md)
- Create required configmaps
- Create deployment for Ads App, based on above entities
- Publish Ads App via Service and Ingress
- Check Ads App running properly together with Ads DB (e.g. create ads via postman, display list of ads in browser, ...)

### [Exercise: "Networkpolicies & TLS for Bulletinboard-Ads and -DB"](exercise_03_ads_app_and_db_networkpolicy.md)
- Increase security and establish a network policy for
  - Ads DB
  - Ads App
- Enable https connection by adding TLS certificates to ingress

### [Exercise: "Using Helm-chart to setup Bulletinboard-Users Application and -DB](exercise_04_users_app_and_db_by_helm.md)
- Create Users DB and Users App via existing helm chart


### [Optional - Exercise: "Create Helm chart for Bulletinboard-Ads Appl. and -DB"](exercise_05_ads_helm_chart.md)
- Develop a Helm chart for Ads Db and Ads App

## Naming of files and labels 

The choosen structure for **Labels** (and with this for **Selectors**) has 2 levels. To separate **Bulletinboard-Ads** from **Bulletinboard-Users** we introduce the **Label** `component` with value `ads` and `users`. To separate the Application-part from the Database-part within each "Component" we introduce the **Label** `module` with value `app` and `db`.  
For name of files and of the entities itself we choose the schema: `<component>-<module>-<entity>.yaml` so e.g the yaml for the service for Bulletinboard-ads application would be named `ads-app-service.yaml`.  
To shorten names in the exercise descriptions, entities will be referenced by their component & module values, like __ads:app__ to name the pod(s) for bulletinboard-ads application pod.
