# Exercise 6 - ConfigMaps & Secrets
ConfigMaps and secrets bridge the gap between the requirements to build generic images but run them with a specific configuration in an secured environment.
In this exercise you will move credentials and configuration into the Kubernetes cluster and make them available to your pods.

## Step 0: clean-up
Before you start with this exercise, remove the deployment(s) and service(s) from the previous excercises. **However do NOT delete the persistentVolumeClaim!** We will use it in this excercise as well. Check the cheat sheet for respective delete commands.

## Step 1: Create a certificate
In the first exercises you ran a webserver with plain http. Now you are going to rebuild this setup and add https to your nginx.

Start by creating a new certificate:

`openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /tmp/nginx.key -out /tmp/nginx.crt -subj "/CN=nginxsvc/O=nginxsvc"`

## Step 2: Store the certificate in Kubernetes
In order to use the certificate with our nginx, you need to add it to kubernetes and store it in a `secret` resource of type `tls` in your namespace.

`kubectl  create secret tls nginx-sec --cert=/tmp/nginx.crt --key=/tmp/nginx.key`

Check, if the secret is present by running `kubectl get secret nginx-sec`.

Run `kubectl describe secret nginx-sec` to get more detailed information. The result should look like this:

```
Name:         nginx-sec
...

Type:  kubernetes.io/tls

Data
====
tls.crt:  1143 bytes
tls.key:  1708 bytes
```

**Important: remember the file names in the data section of the output. They are relevant for the next step.**

## Step 3: Create a ngnix configuration
Once the certificate secret is prepared, create a configuration and store it to kubernetes as well.

Download from [gitHub](./solutions/default.conf) or create a file `default.conf` with the following content:

```
server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;

        listen 443 ssl;

        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;

        server_name localhost;
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/tls.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/tls.key;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location /healthz {
          access_log off;
          return 200 'OK';
        }

        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        }

}
```

Make sure, the values for `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` match the names of the files within the secret. In this example output the files are named `tls.crt` & `tls.key` in the secret as well as the configuration. The location in the filesystem will be set via the `volmeMount`, when you create your deployment.  
Also note, that there is a location explicitly defined for a healthcheck. If called, `/healthz` will return a status code `200` to satisfy a liveness probe.

## Step 4: Upload the configuration to kubernetes
Run `kubectl create configmap nginxconf --from-file=<path/to/your/>default.conf` to create a configMap resource with the corresponding content from default.conf.

Verify the configmap exists with `kubectl get configmap`

## Step 5: Combine everything into a deployment
Now it is time to combine the persistentVolumeClaim, secret and configMap in a new deployment. In order for new the setup to work, use `app: nginx-https` as label/selector for the "secured" nginx.

Try to complete the snippet by inserting the missing parts (look for `???` blocks). Alternatively download the solution from [gitHub](./solutions/deployment_https.yaml) and store it locally.

```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-https
  labels:
    app: nginx-https
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      ???: ???
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-https
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: content-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: nginx-pvc
          readOnly: true
      - name: tls-secret
        secret:
          secretName: nginx-sec
      - name: nginxconf
        configMap:
          name: nginxconf
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.13.6
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: http
        - containerPort: 443
          name: https
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: ???
            port: https
          initialDelaySeconds: 3
          periodSeconds: 5
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: content-storage
          readOnly: true
        - mountPath: /etc/nginx/ssl
          name: ???
          readOnly: true
        - mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf.d
          name: ???
```

Verify that the newly created pods use the pvc, configMap and secret by running `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`.

## Step 6: create a service
Finally, you have to create a new service to expose your https-deployment.

Either figure out the ports needed and extend the service.yaml from the previous exercise or download the service_https.yaml from [gitHub](./solutions/service_https.yaml).

Once the service has an external IP try to call it with an https prefix. Check the certificate it returns - it should match the subject & organization specified in step 1.
