# Further Reading/Watching

If you would like to get some more information on Docker and/or Kubernetes inside and outside of SAP, we would like to share some links with you.

## Docker

- Our talk about the absolute container basics at SAP's *devX* event: [Container 101](https://video.sap.com/media/t/1_gxz1oox7/84675141)

- The Dockerfile reference can be found on Docker's website: [Dockerfile Reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

## Kubernetes

- First of all: SAP offers an internal Kubernetes platform offering that is called Project Gardener. If you need a Kubernetes environment, go here: [Gardener](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/kubernetes/gardener/)

- If there was a Container 101 talk at *devX*, there must be a Kubernetes 102 talk as well: [Kubernetes 102](https://video.sap.com/media/t/1_64gue1c2/84675141)

- Interested in the architecture behing Gardener? There was a talk about it at *devX*, too:
[Project Gardener: Multicloud Kubernetes Cluster Provisioning at Scale](https://video.sap.com/media/t/1_9ifoaxbx/84675141)

- Another talk at *devX* was about resource management in Kubernetes:
[Inside Kubernetes Resource Management (QoS) â€“ Mechanics and Lessons from the Field](https://video.sap.com/media/t/1_hcnybwp9/84675141)

- The nitty gritty details about the networking in and behind Kubernetes are explained in the final *devX* talk we would like to point you to: [Insights into Kubernetes](https://video.sap.com/media/t/1_8fawa5io/84675141)

- The Kubernetes API reference can be found here: [Kubernetes API reference Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/).
